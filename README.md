# About Jackson

#### I'm a web developer with a passion for good documentation and a knack for solving problems.

My background in web development has given me an understanding of how to work with complex technical information and present it in a way that is easy to grasp, clear to navigate, and attractive to look at. I'm always looking for ways to learn new skills, and make technical documentation more accessible.

When I'm not writing and coding, you can find me working on graphic design projects. I have a decade of experience in branding, publication design, digital prepress, and motion graphics. I like to create visually engaging designs that are as effective as they are beautiful.

I also like retro handhelds and SBCs, old school RPGs, and Archie comic books.
